# Sneaker Builder

Welcome to Sneaker Builder, an interactive Mixed Reality experience where users can hold, inspect, customize, and check the sizes when shopping for sneakers virtually in their own environment. This project demonstrates how WebXR can revolutionize e-commerce, allowing customers to interact with products in a whole new way.
